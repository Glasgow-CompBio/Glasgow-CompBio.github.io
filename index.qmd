## Hackathon 2025

Following the success of our CompBio 2024 Hackathon, we are happy to start planning the next one.

This year we have decided to change the process of collecting project proposals. We are going to start with an initial expression of interest and an abstract submission. Below is the outlined hackathon timeline.

Step 1: Abstract submission ([email us](mailto:compbio-conference@glasgow.ac.uk) with a short abstract, no longer than 500 words). Deadline: **December 18th, 2024**. Following the abstract submission, the team will review your abstracts and liaise further with you to help shape exciting but achievable projects.

Step 2: Full project proposal deadline: March, 2025 TBC. Only projects that have completed Step 1 will be considered.

Step 3: Participants application form opens April 2025

Step 4: Hackathon event, 3 exciting days in June 2025 (TBC)

Let us know if you have any questions, we can't wait to see your ideas!

#### Topics of Interest

-   Omics
-   Systems Biology
-   Population Genetics
-   Medical Imaging
-   Computational approaches to public health and clinical data

#### Our Goal

The University of Glasgow computational biology conference is an opportunity for Ph.D. students and early career researchers to come together to share ideas and build collaboration for future projects. The conference will cover a wide variety of applied and methodological research related to computational biology, and we welcome researchers from a variety of backgrounds.

If your research area is not covered by the list above but it's still relevant to computational biology, do not hesitate to submit an abstract. The conference will give the chance for students and early career researchers to present their work, but also give them the opportunity to listen to established researchers from within the University of Glasgow. See the confirmed list of keynote speakers. This event provides excellent opportunities to network and discuss your research.
