    "text": "Welcome to the University of Glasgow Computational Biology Hackathon.¬†\nAre you passionate about unravelling the mysteries of life through code and data? Do you dream of collaborating with brilliant minds to tackle complex biological problems? Look no further! Our exclusive hackathon is designed for researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share a common goal: advancing computational biology.\n\n\n\nDate: 12th-14th June, 2024\nTime: 10am-4pm\nLocation: McMillan Round Reading Room, Main Campus, University Avenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Exploration: Dive into the intersection of biology, computer science, and big data analysis.\nNetworking: Connect with fellow researchers and forge collaborative relationships across the University.\nChallenging Problems: We have curated an exciting range of projects with associated data. Choose your challenge!\nSkill Enhancement: Learn new coding and data handling skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nPostgrads: Whether you‚Äôre a Masters or a PhD candidate, this hackathon is your chance to apply computational techniques to real-world biological questions.\nResearchers: Join forces with fellow scientists to crack complex problems. Collaborate, brainstorm, and innovate!\nPIs: Share your expertise and mentor the next generation of computational biologists.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of a compact and concurrently accessible open-source standard file format for pyramidal whole slide pathology Images to facilitate AI training.\n\nProject lead: Chris Walsh (c.walsh@crukscotlandinstitute.ac.uk)\nAdvances in digital pathology have revolutionised the field but resulted has in the challenge of managing vast amounts of data. However, whole slide imaging scanners output the data in proprietary formats which often lack accessibility and flexibility. To address the issue here we propose building a new open source pyramidal file format.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\n\nHGP-LASAGNE: Resolving histopathological growth patterns in colorectal‚Äìliver metastasis into layers of spatial heterogeneity\n\nProject lead: Tengyu Zhang (t.zhang.6@research.gla.ac.uk)\nColorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health challenge, ranking as the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is a critical need to understand the metastatic processes and imaging based spatial transcriptomics offers this unique opportunity. The goal of the hackathon is to analyse unpublished spatial transcriptomics data from Jamieson Spatial Lab.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\nPlease note that you will have to sign a data sharing/protection declaration before starting work on this project.\n\nHost-Pathogen Extractor: Using text mining, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning to automate database creation for infectious disease research and surveillance\n\nProject Lead: Max Farrel (maxwell.farrell@glasgow.ac.uk)\nLarge scale databases of host-pathogen interactions underlie models that predict future emerging infectious disease threats, and guide surveillance of cross-species pathogens. As the number of papers increases exponentially, automated ways of extracting this information should be considered, however those have been rare in ecology. As part of this project, the hackathon teams will explore different ways of extracting host-pathogen interactions from abstracts, from traditional pattern matching to applying large language models.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\n\nThe FAIR Data Pipeline: Provenance driven data management\n\nProject lead: Ryan Field (ryan.field@glasgow.ac.uk)\nTo address the issues of FAIR and traceable data and models, the FAIR data pipeline was developed. It is available for various programming languages and is continuously developed by a very small team. The project would greatly benefit from further testing, bug fixing and tutorials. During the Hackathon we hope that team members can test the pipeline on their own real world data and help improve the user experience and documentation.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\n\nDevelopment of an iCLIP2 data analysis tool, mapping protein footprints on RNA.\n\nProject lead: Rozeena Arif r.arif.1@research.gla.ac.uk\nProject Summary: Protein-RNA interactions play a vital role in virus-host infections. It thus becomes essential to identify the binding interfaces between these two molecules for efficient understanding and manipulation of the mechanism. CLIP experiments provide highly precise binding sites during interaction. Analysis of such data is a complex, multistep and attention demanding process. We propose to build a pipeline to automate the analysis steps considering specific conditions of an experiment.\nMore information about this project can be found here\n\n\n\nQ1: I want to participate but worried about my coding skills/AI knowledge/etc?\nA1: Hackathons are a great environment to learn, so don‚Äôt worry, just be upfront with your team lead. You can still contribute in so many ways, like ideas, writing, biological knowledge, management, etc.\nQ2: I can only attend 2 out of the 3 days. Is this a problem?\nA2: While attending the full duration of the Hackathon would be beneficial, we understand that committing 3 days might be difficult for some. Please include that information in your application form.\nQ3: I am a master student and worried about my skills suitability.\nA3: See Q1. We welcome participants from diverse backgrounds and you can contribute in many different ways. Also, please note that most projects require initial preparation before the Hackathon.\nQ4: What if I don‚Äôt know any other participants?\nA4: This is a great opportunity to get to know people from across the university! You don‚Äôt need to have spoken to anyone prior to signing up, just fill out the sign-up form and you will be made very welcome.\nQ5: Will I definitely be included in the team for my preferred project?\nA5: We aim to offer every participant a spot on their preferred team but this may not be possible if a project is oversubscribed. This is why we ask you to rank projects by preference on the sign-up form. If there is a project you don‚Äôt want to be considered for, please indicate this on the form.\n\n\n\nReady to embark on this scientific adventure? Pick your preferred project and reserve your spot now. Limited slots available! Please express your interest and fill in the form by the 31st of May."

Apply here by 1st May 2025.\nWelcome to the University of Glasgow Computational Biology Hackathon.¬†\nAre you passionate about unravelling the mysteries of life through code and data? Do you dream of collaborating with brilliant minds to tackle complex biological problems? Look no further! Our exclusive hackathon is designed for researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share a common goal: advancing computational biology.\nSee what we got up to last year!\n\n\nThis year we have decided to change the process of collecting project proposals. We are going to start with an initial expression of interest and an abstract submission. Below is the outlined hackathon timeline.\n\nStep 1: Abstract submission (email us¬†with a short abstract, no longer than 500 words). Deadline:¬†December 18th, 2024 (Closed). Following the abstract submission, the team will review your abstracts and liaise further with you to help shape exciting but achievable projects.\nStep 2: Full project proposal deadline: March, 2025 (Closed). Only projects that have completed Step 1 will be considered.\nStep 3: Participants application form opens 1st April 2025, and closes 1st May 2025 (now open!)\nStep 4: Hackathon event, 4-6th June 2025\n\nLet us know if you have any questions, we can‚Äôt wait to see your ideas!\n\n\n\n\nDate: 4-6th June, 2025\nTime: 10am-4pm\nLocation: McMillan Round Reading Room, University Ave, Glasgow, G12 8QF\n\n\n\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Exploration: Dive into the intersection of biology, computer science, and big data analysis.\nNetworking: Connect with fellow researchers and forge collaborative relationships across the University.\nChallenging Problems: We have curated an exciting range of projects with associated data. Choose your challenge!\nSkill Enhancement: Learn new coding and data handling skills.\n\n\n\n\nWhatever your career stage or job title, we would love to hear from you if you have skills you think could benefit a team. Whether you are from a wet-lab, dry-lab, or non-lab background, we would love you to bring your skills to a highly interdisciplinary team. We strongly encourage those in non-research roles and those from non-traditional scientific backgrounds to apply, and we select participants based on skills and enthusiasm, not perceived status!\n\nUndergrads: Are you interested in problem solving? Do you have programming skills you wish to apply to biological problems? Do you have biological knowledge you can bring to a team? Are you wondering if research is a potential next step? Sign up!¬†\nPostgrads: Whether you‚Äôre a Masters or a PhD candidate, this hackathon is your chance to apply computational techniques to real-world biological questions.\nResearchers: Join forces with fellow scientists to crack complex problems. Collaborate, brainstorm, and innovate!\nScientific/Technical Staff: Can you bring your expertise or insight to help solve biological problems? Please sign up!\nPIs: Share your expertise and mentor the next generation of computational biologists.\n\n\n\n\n3D Big Data ‚Äì developing a pipeline from microscope to discovery¬†\nAdvances in light microscopy and tissue clearing techniques allow us to image whole mouse organs in minutes-to-hours. This generates large datasets and processing them is not trivial. During the hackathon we will work towards developing a robust workflow to help with the processing of such datasets.¬†¬†\nFull Project Description¬†\nGraph-Based Representations for Storing Sequence Alignments¬†\nThe continuous growth of sequencing data has brought a pressing need for efficient storage and analysis of genomic information. Traditional methods for storing multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) or reference-based read alignments (BAM/CRAM), are often large files with significant levels of sequence redundancy.¬† Can we do better and use a graph-based approach for representation?\nFull Project Description¬†\nMining and visualisation of cell type-specific sequence alignment data to evaluate alternative splicing¬†\nGenome browsers do not have an effective way of visualising and annotating alternative introns/exons. Starting with BAM files the project aims to develop ways of highlighting regions that require annotation and improve on visualisation of alternative splicing.¬†¬†\nFull Project Description¬†\nMultiomics Data Integration for Oncology Classification Models¬†\nGenerating multiple data modalities from the same patient samples is increasingly common. This allows for a range of biological questions to be addressed and provides an exciting data integration challenge. The goal of the hackathon is to tackle a multimodal integration challenge for a cancer dataset.\nFull Project Description¬†\n\n\n\nQ1: I want to participate but worried about my coding skills/AI knowledge/etc?\nA1: Hackathons are a great environment to learn, so don‚Äôt worry, just be upfront with your team lead. You can still contribute in so many ways, like ideas, writing, biological knowledge, management, etc.\nQ2: I can only attend 2 out of the 3 days.

Traditional methods for storing multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) or reference-based read alignments (BAM/CRAM), are often large files with significant levels of sequence redundancy.¬† Can we do better and use a graph-based approach for representation?\nFull Project Description¬†\nMining and visualisation of cell type-specific sequence alignment data to evaluate alternative splicing¬†\nGenome browsers do not have an effective way of visualising and annotating alternative introns/exons. Starting with BAM files the project aims to develop ways of highlighting regions that require annotation and improve on visualisation of alternative splicing.¬†¬†\nFull Project Description¬†\nMultiomics Data Integration for Oncology Classification Models¬†\nGenerating multiple data modalities from the same patient samples is increasingly common. This allows for a range of biological questions to be addressed and provides an exciting data integration challenge. The goal of the hackathon is to tackle a multimodal integration challenge for a cancer dataset.\nFull Project Description"

Attendees particularly enjoyed sessions on¬†generative AI,¬†clustering methods (Paul Kirk‚Äôs talk), and¬†colorectal cancer subtyping (Philip Dunn‚Äôs talk). Many also found the lightning talks¬†useful in identifying researchers with overlapping interests.\n\n\nNetworking Opportunities\nA strong conference isn‚Äôt just about content - it‚Äôs about connections. Attendees appreciated the chance to network, whether through informal discussions during breaks or structured sessions. Several participants mentioned making valuable new contacts and collaborations.\n\n\nSmooth Organisation & Logistics\nFor the most part, logistics ran smoothly. Our venue, generously provided by ARC, served as an excellent space for discussions and presentations. The conference remained accessible and welcoming, with attendees appreciating the effort that went into planning."

Requests included¬†biodiversity, epidemiology, spatial ecology, metagenomics, computational statistics, and research on pathogens/viruses. We‚Äôll consider how to integrate these into next year‚Äôs lineup.\n\n\nTiming & Scheduling\nThere was some debate about the best time of year for the conference. While September worked for many, some participants preferred July (as in 2023) due to fewer competing academic obligations. We‚Äôll assess the best option moving forward.\n\n\nPresentation Logistics & Program Distribution\nA few attendees faced¬†technical issues with slides and presenter view, which we aim to resolve next year. Additionally, some attendees would have liked the¬†conference program distributed in advance¬†to better plan their participation.\n\n\nFood & Catering\nWhile the lunch provided was generally well-received, there were suggestions for¬†more variety, clearer labeling of vegetarian vs.¬†non-vegetarian options, and snacks during coffee breaks. We‚Äôll be working with our caterers to address these requests.\n\n\nEnhancing Networking & Engagement\nWhile networking opportunities were valuable, some attendees suggested¬†longer lunch breaks or more structured networking sessions¬†to facilitate meaningful discussions. We‚Äôre considering ideas such as¬†ECR (Early Career Researcher) networking sessions¬†or topic-based discussion groups."

    "text": "Magnus Rattray is a Professor of Computational & Systems Biology and Director of the Institute for Data Science & Artificial Intelligence of the University of Manchester. He is also a Turing Fellow.\n\nBiography\n2012 - Present: Professor of Computational and Systems Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester\n2010 - 2012: Professor of Statistical Bioinformatics and Machine Learning, Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience and Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield\n1998 - 2010: Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester\n1996 - 1998: EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Associate, Neural Computing Research Group, Department of Applied Mathematics, Aston University\n1993-1996:¬†PhD Computer Science, University of Manchester\n1989-1992: BSc (1st class hons) Mathematics and Physics, University of Manchester\n\n\nResearch interests\nMy group works on how to learn models and make inferences given evidence from high-throughput biological datasets. The models that we develop range from mechanistic differential equation models of the cell to more abstract probabilistic latent variable models that can be used uncover interesting structure in high-dimensional data. We are particularly interested in hybrid models that combine aspects of mechanistic and probabilistic models.\nModels encode our hypotheses about how biological systems work. We use probabilistic inference to learn the model parameters and to choose between competing models so as to identify the hypotheses best supported by the available experimental evidence. Bayesian inference and non-parametric modelling is a particular focus as this provides a principled framework for dealing with uncertainty in complex systems. We are applying our methods to infer gene regulatory networks from time-series mRNA expression and DNA-protein binding data, to uncover changes in the transcriptome from RNA-Seq datasets, and to develop novel inference algorithms for time-series data analysis and systems biology modelling.\n\n\nOverview\nBiology has become a data-rich science. Modern high-throughput experimental techniques can make simultaneous measurements of vast numbers of biological molecules and their interactions. These measurements can be taken at different times during some biological process, resulting in time-series data. My research group works on the interpretation of these datasets by building predictive models of biological systems using computer algorithms. We have developed methods to uncover the patterns underlying gene expression changes in time and to uncover the complex network of molecular interactions between DNA and proteins which regulate this process. We are also interested in how biological systems change and adapt over much longer evolutionary time-scales using phylogenetic models."

It is possible that there are common biological mechanisms for both mental and physical traits. If so, some medications currently used for cardiometabolic disorders could be repurposed to improve mental health and reduce long-term complications in those with serious mental illness.\nI aim to investigate whether common biological mechanisms underlie physical and mental illness by:\n\nExploring the genetic basis of serious mental illness, using cross-diagnostic traits associated with psychiatric diseases (following the research domain criteria (RDoC) approach)\nAssessing the impact of genetic susceptibility to serious mental illness on cardiometabolic traits.\nUsing genetics to improve prediction of risk, severity and outcomes in serious mental illness."

    "text": "Dr Dunne is currently a joint appointment as a Reader in Molecular Pathology within the Patrick G. Johnston Centre for Cancer Research (PGJCCR), Queen‚Äôs University Belfast and a Group Leader at the CRUK Scotland Institute in Glasgow.\nMolecular Pathology and Tumour Signalling in Early Disseminating Colorectal Cancer (CRC)\nCRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world and is the second highest cause of cancer-related death in Europe. This is mainly due to the ineffectiveness of current chemotherapy treatments for late stage and advanced metastatic disease. Despite advances in our understanding of the biology of these tumours, there have been disappointingly few advances in CRC therapy in the last 20 years. Recent work has highlighted the importance of the chemical messages that arise from cells that support the tumour (tumour microenvironment), yet current understanding of CRC is based largely on the epithelial tumour cells themselves. The Molecular Pathology Research Group is focused on investigating mechanisms underlying disease progression in CRC, with a particular interest in understanding the crosstalk between tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment associated with early dissemination of tumour cells. The research programme also includes development of molecular subtypes, using signalling associated with intrinsic (epithelial) and extrinsic (stromal and immune) components of the tumour."

    "text": "Dr Catalina Vallejos is a Group Leader at the MRC Human Genetics Unit and a Turing Fellow.\n\nResearch in a Nutshell¬†\nWhile biomedical data sometimes classifies as ‚Äúbig data‚Äù (where the number of samples and/or variables is large), complexity is its most prominent feature. This arises from a combination of different sources of heterogeneity: heterogeneity across individuals in a population (e.g.¬†response to treatment), heterogeneity in terms of the type of data we collect (e.g.¬†health records & genomics) and heterogeneity that is introduced by the data collection process (e.g.¬†measurement error).\nWe focus on the development of novel statistical methodology to address and study these sources of heterogeneity. This is a highly multidisciplinary task: from the understanding of complex biomedical problems and technologies, to the development of new methodology and the implementation of open-source analysis tools. Our current research focuses on two areas of application. Firstly, single-cell RNA-sequencing, a cutting-edge experimental technique that allows genome-wide quantification of gene expression on a cell-by-cell basis. Secondly, electronic health records research, to develop predictive models based on observational data that is routinely collected by health providers (e.g.¬†NHS). Developing computational tools that can make full advantage of the rich information provided by these data sources is ought to improve our understanding of health and disease, playing an important role in precision medicine initiatives."

By using computational models to represent cells he can show that the predicted movement of these cells based on self-generated gradients is similar to that of real cells."

    "text": "Register here! Booking via Inkpath from 23/04\nThe Glasgow Computational Biology Community will be hosting its very first writing retreat as part of the 2025 ‚ÄúWrite of Spring‚Äù festival!\nThis session is open to anyone with an interest in the field of computational biology, from PGR to professor! Regardless of if you are polishing a manuscript, drafting a grant, or outlining your next big idea, our structured session will allow you to work alongside a multi-disciplinary gathering and away from daily distractions.\nYou‚Äôll have the opportunity to network with fellow computational biologists, with a generous supply of coffee and cake! So come along and join the community and let‚Äôs get writing!\n\n\n\nDate: 22nd May, 2025\nTime: 9am-1pm\nLocation: Room 237AB, The Mazumdar-Shaw Advanced Research Centre (ARC), 11 Chapel Lane, University of Glasgow, G11 6EW\n\n\n\n\nQ1: What is a ‚Äúwriting retreat‚Äù?\nA1: Writing retreats are sessions led by a facilitator, where participants are encouraged to tackle a measurable writing goal that they would like to complete. This might be something that they have put off and need a little extra motivation to get started on, such as writing up a Thesis chapter or drafting a manuscript. The emphasis is on avoiding distraction and procrastination, in a supportive, structured environment alongside like-minded individuals.\nQ2: What will happen during the retreat?\nA2: Like many other writing retreats, we will utilise the Pomodoro Technique, with blocks of 25 minutes of concentrated writing, interspersed with 5 minute breaks. There will be a longer break halfway through the session, during which participants can choose to network or simply refresh.\nQ3: What should I bring?\nA3: Whether you prefer to write on your laptop, or simply with pen and paper, just make sure you have everything you need to achieve your writing goal. While it is understandable that some participants will need to use the internet, you will be encouraged to have your phone on silent, and forgo checking emails / other distractions. This is both to avoid disturbing fellow attendees, and also to help you maintain focus.\nQ4: Will there be any catering?\nA4: Coffee, tea and seasonal fruit will be available throughout the session. A selection of cakes will be made available during the halfway break. You will have the opportunity to specify any dietary requirements on the Inkpath booking form.\nQ5: Can I join remotely?\nA5: This will be an in-person only session. This will makes things easier to facilitate and avoid any AV-related distractions that a hybrid event can bring. If you are interested in attending a virtual writing retreat, we recommend the 2 hour sessions found on Inkpath, hosted by a network of universities around Europe."
