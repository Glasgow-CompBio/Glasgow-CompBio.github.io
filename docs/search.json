    "text": "Welcome to the University of Glasgow Computational Biology Hackathon. \nAre you passionate about unravelling the mysteries of life through code and data? Do you dream of collaborating with brilliant minds to tackle complex biological problems? Look no further! Our exclusive hackathon is designed for researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share a common goal: advancing computational biology.\n\n\n\nDate: 12th-14th June, 2024\nTime: 10am-4pm\nLocation: McMillan Round Reading Room, Main Campus, University Avenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Exploration: Dive into the intersection of biology, computer science, and big data analysis.\nNetworking: Connect with fellow researchers and forge collaborative relationships across the University.\nChallenging Problems: We have curated an exciting range of projects with associated data. Choose your challenge!\nSkill Enhancement: Learn new coding and data handling skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nPostgrads: Whether you’re a Masters or a PhD candidate, this hackathon is your chance to apply computational techniques to real-world biological questions.\nResearchers: Join forces with fellow scientists to crack complex problems. Collaborate, brainstorm, and innovate!\nPIs: Share your expertise and mentor the next generation of computational biologists.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of a compact and concurrently accessible open-source standard file format for pyramidal whole slide pathology Images to facilitate AI training.\n\nProject lead: Chris Walsh (c.walsh@crukscotlandinstitute.ac.uk)\nAdvances in digital pathology have revolutionised the field but resulted has in the challenge of managing vast amounts of data. However, whole slide imaging scanners output the data in proprietary formats which often lack accessibility and flexibility. To address the issue here we propose building a new open source pyramidal file format.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\n\nHGP-LASAGNE: Resolving histopathological growth patterns in colorectal–liver metastasis into layers of spatial heterogeneity\n\nProject lead: Tengyu Zhang (t.zhang.6@research.gla.ac.uk)\nColorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health challenge, ranking as the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is a critical need to understand the metastatic processes and imaging based spatial transcriptomics offers this unique opportunity. The goal of the hackathon is to analyse unpublished spatial transcriptomics data from Jamieson Spatial Lab.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\nPlease note that you will have to sign a data sharing/protection declaration before starting work on this project.\n\nHost-Pathogen Extractor: Using text mining, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning to automate database creation for infectious disease research and surveillance\n\nProject Lead: Max Farrel (maxwell.farrell@glasgow.ac.uk)\nLarge scale databases of host-pathogen interactions underlie models that predict future emerging infectious disease threats, and guide surveillance of cross-species pathogens. As the number of papers increases exponentially, automated ways of extracting this information should be considered, however those have been rare in ecology. As part of this project, the hackathon teams will explore different ways of extracting host-pathogen interactions from abstracts, from traditional pattern matching to applying large language models.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\n\nThe FAIR Data Pipeline: Provenance driven data management\n\nProject lead: Ryan Field (ryan.field@glasgow.ac.uk)\nTo address the issues of FAIR and traceable data and models, the FAIR data pipeline was developed. It is available for various programming languages and is continuously developed by a very small team. The project would greatly benefit from further testing, bug fixing and tutorials. During the Hackathon we hope that team members can test the pipeline on their own real world data and help improve the user experience and documentation.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\n\nDevelopment of an iCLIP2 data analysis tool, mapping protein footprints on RNA.\n\nProject lead: Rozeena Arif r.arif.1@research.gla.ac.uk\nProject Summary: Protein-RNA interactions play a vital role in virus-host infections. It thus becomes essential to identify the binding interfaces between these two molecules for efficient understanding and manipulation of the mechanism. CLIP experiments provide highly precise binding sites during interaction. Analysis of such data is a complex, multistep and attention demanding process. We propose to build a pipeline to automate the analysis steps considering specific conditions of an experiment.\nMore information about this project can be found here\n\n\n\nQ1: I want to participate but worried about my coding skills/AI knowledge/etc?\nA1: Hackathons are a great environment to learn, so don’t worry, just be upfront with your team lead. You can still contribute in so many ways, like ideas, writing, biological knowledge, management, etc.\nQ2: I can only attend 2 out of the 3 days. Is this a problem?\nA2: While attending the full duration of the Hackathon would be beneficial, we understand that committing 3 days might be difficult for some. Please include that information in your application form.\nQ3: I am a master student and worried about my skills suitability.\nA3: See Q1. We welcome participants from diverse backgrounds and you can contribute in many different ways. Also, please note that most projects require initial preparation before the Hackathon.\nQ4: What if I don’t know any other participants?\nA4: This is a great opportunity to get to know people from across the university! You don’t need to have spoken to anyone prior to signing up, just fill out the sign-up form and you will be made very welcome.\nQ5: Will I definitely be included in the team for my preferred project?\nA5: We aim to offer every participant a spot on their preferred team but this may not be possible if a project is oversubscribed. This is why we ask you to rank projects by preference on the sign-up form. If there is a project you don’t want to be considered for, please indicate this on the form.\n\n\n\nReady to embark on this scientific adventure? Pick your preferred project and reserve your spot now. Limited slots available! Please express your interest and fill in the form by the 31st of May."

Apply here by 1st May 2025.\nWelcome to the University of Glasgow Computational Biology Hackathon. \nAre you passionate about unravelling the mysteries of life through code and data? Do you dream of collaborating with brilliant minds to tackle complex biological problems? Look no further! Our exclusive hackathon is designed for researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share a common goal: advancing computational biology.\nSee what we got up to last year!\n\n\nThis year we have decided to change the process of collecting project proposals. We are going to start with an initial expression of interest and an abstract submission. Below is the outlined hackathon timeline.\n\nStep 1: Abstract submission (email us with a short abstract, no longer than 500 words). Deadline: December 18th, 2024 (Closed). Following the abstract submission, the team will review your abstracts and liaise further with you to help shape exciting but achievable projects.\nStep 2: Full project proposal deadline: March, 2025 (Closed). Only projects that have completed Step 1 will be considered.\nStep 3: Participants application form opens 1st April 2025, and closes 1st May 2025 (now open!)\nStep 4: Hackathon event, 4-6th June 2025\n\nLet us know if you have any questions, we can’t wait to see your ideas!\n\n\n\n\nDate: 4-6th June, 2025\nTime: 10am-4pm\nLocation: McMillan Round Reading Room, University Ave, Glasgow, G12 8QF\n\n\n\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Exploration: Dive into the intersection of biology, computer science, and big data analysis.\nNetworking: Connect with fellow researchers and forge collaborative relationships across the University.\nChallenging Problems: We have curated an exciting range of projects with associated data. Choose your challenge!\nSkill Enhancement: Learn new coding and data handling skills.\n\n\n\n\nWhatever your career stage or job title, we would love to hear from you if you have skills you think could benefit a team. Whether you are from a wet-lab, dry-lab, or non-lab background, we would love you to bring your skills to a highly interdisciplinary team. We strongly encourage those in non-research roles and those from non-traditional scientific backgrounds to apply, and we select participants based on skills and enthusiasm, not perceived status!\n\nUndergrads: Are you interested in problem solving? Do you have programming skills you wish to apply to biological problems? Do you have biological knowledge you can bring to a team? Are you wondering if research is a potential next step? Sign up! \nPostgrads: Whether you’re a Masters or a PhD candidate, this hackathon is your chance to apply computational techniques to real-world biological questions.\nResearchers: Join forces with fellow scientists to crack complex problems. Collaborate, brainstorm, and innovate!\nScientific/Technical Staff: Can you bring your expertise or insight to help solve biological problems? Please sign up!\nPIs: Share your expertise and mentor the next generation of computational biologists.\n\n\n\n\n3D Big Data – developing a pipeline from microscope to discovery \nAdvances in light microscopy and tissue clearing techniques allow us to image whole mouse organs in minutes-to-hours. This generates large datasets and processing them is not trivial. During the hackathon we will work towards developing a robust workflow to help with the processing of such datasets.  \nFull Project Description \nGraph-Based Representations for Storing Sequence Alignments \nThe continuous growth of sequencing data has brought a pressing need for efficient storage and analysis of genomic information. Traditional methods for storing multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) or reference-based read alignments (BAM/CRAM), are often large files with significant levels of sequence redundancy.  Can we do better and use a graph-based approach for representation?\nFull Project Description \nMining and visualisation of cell type-specific sequence alignment data to evaluate alternative splicing \nGenome browsers do not have an effective way of visualising and annotating alternative introns/exons. Starting with BAM files the project aims to develop ways of highlighting regions that require annotation and improve on visualisation of alternative splicing.  \nFull Project Description \nMultiomics Data Integration for Oncology Classification Models \nGenerating multiple data modalities from the same patient samples is increasingly common. This allows for a range of biological questions to be addressed and provides an exciting data integration challenge. The goal of the hackathon is to tackle a multimodal integration challenge for a cancer dataset.\nFull Project Description \n\n\n\nQ1: I want to participate but worried about my coding skills/AI knowledge/etc?\nA1: Hackathons are a great environment to learn, so don’t worry, just be upfront with your team lead. You can still contribute in so many ways, like ideas, writing, biological knowledge, management, etc.\nQ2: I can only attend 2 out of the 3 days.

You don’t need to have spoken to anyone prior to signing up, you will be made very welcome, and there will be many other people in the same position.\nQ5: Will I definitely be included in the team for my preferred project?\nA5: We aim to offer every participant a spot on their preferred team but this may not be possible if a project is oversubscribed. If there is a project you don’t want to be considered for, please indicate this on the form.\n\n\n\nSign up here! Registration closes 1st May 2025\n\n\n\nWe are hugely grateful to our sponsors – without their support this event would not be possible!"

During the hackathon we will work towards developing a robust workflow to help with the processing of such datasets.  \nFull Project Description \nGraph-Based Representations for Storing Sequence Alignments \nThe continuous growth of sequencing data has brought a pressing need for efficient storage and analysis of genomic information. Traditional methods for storing multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) or reference-based read alignments (BAM/CRAM), are often large files with significant levels of sequence redundancy.  Can we do better and use a graph-based approach for representation?\nFull Project Description \nMining and visualisation of cell type-specific sequence alignment data to evaluate alternative splicing \nGenome browsers do not have an effective way of visualising and annotating alternative introns/exons. Starting with BAM files the project aims to develop ways of highlighting regions that require annotation and improve on visualisation of alternative splicing.  \nFull Project Description \nMultiomics Data Integration for Oncology Classification Models \nGenerating multiple data modalities from the same patient samples is increasingly common. This allows for a range of biological questions to be addressed and provides an exciting data integration challenge. The goal of the hackathon is to tackle a multimodal integration challenge for a cancer dataset.\nFull Project Description"

    "text": "What Went Well\n\nEngaging Talks & Panels\nOne of the standout aspects of this year’s event was the quality of the keynote and panel discussions. Attendees particularly enjoyed sessions on generative AI, clustering methods (Paul Kirk’s talk), and colorectal cancer subtyping (Philip Dunn’s talk). Many also found the lightning talks useful in identifying researchers with overlapping interests.\n\n\nNetworking Opportunities\nA strong conference isn’t just about content - it’s about connections. Attendees appreciated the chance to network, whether through informal discussions during breaks or structured sessions. Several participants mentioned making valuable new contacts and collaborations.\n\n\nSmooth Organisation & Logistics\nFor the most part, logistics ran smoothly. Our venue, generously provided by ARC, served as an excellent space for discussions and presentations. The conference remained accessible and welcoming, with attendees appreciating the effort that went into planning."

    "text": "What We Can Improve\n\nExpanding Topic Diversity\nWhile our core themes were well-received, some attendees suggested a broader range of topics. Requests included biodiversity, epidemiology, spatial ecology, metagenomics, computational statistics, and research on pathogens/viruses. We’ll consider how to integrate these into next year’s lineup.\n\n\nTiming & Scheduling\nThere was some debate about the best time of year for the conference. While September worked for many, some participants preferred July (as in 2023) due to fewer competing academic obligations. We’ll assess the best option moving forward.\n\n\nPresentation Logistics & Program Distribution\nA few attendees faced technical issues with slides and presenter view, which we aim to resolve next year. Additionally, some attendees would have liked the conference program distributed in advance to better plan their participation.\n\n\nFood & Catering\nWhile the lunch provided was generally well-received, there were suggestions for more variety, clearer labeling of vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian options, and snacks during coffee breaks. We’ll be working with our caterers to address these requests.\n\n\nEnhancing Networking & Engagement\nWhile networking opportunities were valuable, some attendees suggested longer lunch breaks or more structured networking sessions to facilitate meaningful discussions. We’re considering ideas such as ECR (Early Career Researcher) networking sessions or topic-based discussion groups."

    "text": "Magnus Rattray is a Professor of Computational & Systems Biology and Director of the Institute for Data Science & Artificial Intelligence of the University of Manchester. He is also a Turing Fellow.\n\nBiography\n2012 - Present: Professor of Computational and Systems Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester\n2010 - 2012: Professor of Statistical Bioinformatics and Machine Learning, Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience and Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield\n1998 - 2010: Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester\n1996 - 1998: EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Associate, Neural Computing Research Group, Department of Applied Mathematics, Aston University\n1993-1996: PhD Computer Science, University of Manchester\n1989-1992: BSc (1st class hons) Mathematics and Physics, University of Manchester\n\n\nResearch interests\nMy group works on how to learn models and make inferences given evidence from high-throughput biological datasets. The models that we develop range from mechanistic differential equation models of the cell to more abstract probabilistic latent variable models that can be used uncover interesting structure in high-dimensional data. We are particularly interested in hybrid models that combine aspects of mechanistic and probabilistic models.\nModels encode our hypotheses about how biological systems work. We use probabilistic inference to learn the model parameters and to choose between competing models so as to identify the hypotheses best supported by the available experimental evidence. Bayesian inference and non-parametric modelling is a particular focus as this provides a principled framework for dealing with uncertainty in complex systems. We are applying our methods to infer gene regulatory networks from time-series mRNA expression and DNA-protein binding data, to uncover changes in the transcriptome from RNA-Seq datasets, and to develop novel inference algorithms for time-series data analysis and systems biology modelling.\n\n\nOverview\nBiology has become a data-rich science. Modern high-throughput experimental techniques can make simultaneous measurements of vast numbers of biological molecules and their interactions. These measurements can be taken at different times during some biological process, resulting in time-series data. My research group works on the interpretation of these datasets by building predictive models of biological systems using computer algorithms. We have developed methods to uncover the patterns underlying gene expression changes in time and to uncover the complex network of molecular interactions between DNA and proteins which regulate this process. We are also interested in how biological systems change and adapt over much longer evolutionary time-scales using phylogenetic models."

It is possible that there are common biological mechanisms for both mental and physical traits. If so, some medications currently used for cardiometabolic disorders could be repurposed to improve mental health and reduce long-term complications in those with serious mental illness.\nI aim to investigate whether common biological mechanisms underlie physical and mental illness by:\n\nExploring the genetic basis of serious mental illness, using cross-diagnostic traits associated with psychiatric diseases (following the research domain criteria (RDoC) approach)\nAssessing the impact of genetic susceptibility to serious mental illness on cardiometabolic traits.\nUsing genetics to improve prediction of risk, severity and outcomes in serious mental illness."

Johnston Centre for Cancer Research (PGJCCR), Queen’s University Belfast and a Group Leader at the CRUK Scotland Institute in Glasgow.\nMolecular Pathology and Tumour Signalling in Early Disseminating Colorectal Cancer (CRC)\nCRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world and is the second highest cause of cancer-related death in Europe. This is mainly due to the ineffectiveness of current chemotherapy treatments for late stage and advanced metastatic disease. Despite advances in our understanding of the biology of these tumours, there have been disappointingly few advances in CRC therapy in the last 20 years. Recent work has highlighted the importance of the chemical messages that arise from cells that support the tumour (tumour microenvironment), yet current understanding of CRC is based largely on the epithelial tumour cells themselves. The Molecular Pathology Research Group is focused on investigating mechanisms underlying disease progression in CRC, with a particular interest in understanding the crosstalk between tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment associated with early dissemination of tumour cells. The research programme also includes development of molecular subtypes, using signalling associated with intrinsic (epithelial) and extrinsic (stromal and immune) components of the tumour."

    "text": "Dr Catalina Vallejos is a Group Leader at the MRC Human Genetics Unit and a Turing Fellow.\n\nResearch in a Nutshell \nWhile biomedical data sometimes classifies as “big data” (where the number of samples and/or variables is large), complexity is its most prominent feature. This arises from a combination of different sources of heterogeneity: heterogeneity across individuals in a population (e.g. response to treatment), heterogeneity in terms of the type of data we collect (e.g. health records & genomics) and heterogeneity that is introduced by the data collection process (e.g. measurement error).\nWe focus on the development of novel statistical methodology to address and study these sources of heterogeneity. This is a highly multidisciplinary task: from the understanding of complex biomedical problems and technologies, to the development of new methodology and the implementation of open-source analysis tools. Our current research focuses on two areas of application. Firstly, single-cell RNA-sequencing, a cutting-edge experimental technique that allows genome-wide quantification of gene expression on a cell-by-cell basis. Secondly, electronic health records research, to develop predictive models based on observational data that is routinely collected by health providers (e.g. NHS). Developing computational tools that can make full advantage of the rich information provided by these data sources is ought to improve our understanding of health and disease, playing an important role in precision medicine initiatives."

    "text": "Title: Spatially Resolved Single Cell Analysis of Bevacizumab-induced Enhancement of anti-PD1 Response in Nasopharyngeal Cancer\nAbstract: Clinical outcome data from our recent Phase II randomized study aimed at interrogating the benefit of combining anti-VEGF therapy (Bevacizumab) with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB, Pembrolizumab) in advanced nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) showed a ~4x increase in overall survival rate (ORR) in the combinatorial arm compared to anti-PD1 monotherapy (Lancet Oncology 2025). In this study, we employed single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic analyses on longitudinal, serial biopsies from patients with matched clinical outcome data, to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms and prognostic biomarkers associated with how anti-angiogenic therapy may regulate anti-PD1 response. Notably, our single cell-spatiotemporal analyses revealed that one week of Bevacizumab monotherapy alone can remarkably alter and prime the tumour ecosystem into an immune-active state. Specifically, we elucidate the anti-VEGFA-induced alterations in cell types, cell states, and spatial neighbourhoods that promote vascular normalization, and a proinflammatory switch in myeloid cells as well as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which facilitate reversal of immune tolerance, and restoration ICB response. Additionally, gene regulatory network analysis and interrogation of spatially-aware cell-cell interactions associated with emergence cell-states, and dynamic alterations in response-associated spatial niches, revealed potential pathways and cross-regulatory interactions that may control therapy response. Altogether, our study reveals a critical role for stromal remodelling in promoting immunotherapy response, while opening new avenues of investigation into alternative targets for combinatorial interventions to enhance immunotherapy response.\nBio: Dr. DasGupta graduated with a double Bachelor’s degree, in Chemistry (B.Sc. Hons., University of Delhi, India, 1994), and in Genetics (B.A., Cambridge University, UK, 1996). He obtained his Ph. D. in Developmental Biology and Molecular Medicine from the University of Chicago, 2002. Dr. DasGupta conducted his postdoctoral research at the Harvard Medical School, where he pioneered whole-genome high-throughput, RNAi-based functional genomic screens to identify novel regulators of cell-signalling pathways. In 2006, Dr. DasGupta established his own research laboratory at the NYU-Cancer Institute, where he served as an Associate Professor till 2014. Thereafter, he moved to the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS), where as a Senior Group Leader he led a program in Precision Oncology and Cancer Evolution. More recently, Dr. DasGupta has taken up the position of Professor of Cancer Systems Biology at the School of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow and the CRUK-Scotland Institute. The major focus of his laboratory is to interrogate the mechanistic basis for how damage-associated regenerative programs in the intra-hepatic microenvironment drives progression of chronic disease to HCC. The DasGupta lab utilizes a variety of single cell and spatial multi-omic approaches to define mechanisms underlying spatio-temporal cross-regulatory interactions between pathogenic cells and their microenvironment that drive cellular plasticity and phenotypic heterogeneity during tumorigenesis as well as tumor progression, in etiologically distinct liver cancers.

    "text": "Title: Marine microbial biodiscovery - using biological questions to uncover patterns in\nmicrobial ’omics data\n\nAbstract: Microbial drug discovery in the ’omics era relies on three key datasets,\nbiosynthetic, chemical and biological (activity). Yet, to integrate and interrogate\nthese large and complex datasets remains a challenge and results in the low-\nthroughput prioritization of only a few strains based on observed antibiotic activity.\nDespite this wealth of genomic and metabolomic data, linking metabolites to the\nBGC responsible for their production and to observed bioactivity is limited, slow\n(manual) and challenging. Furthermore, our current discovery is reliant on existing\nbiosynthetic, chemical and antibiotic knowledge, thus overlooking unidentified\nparent ions (metabolites) or hypothetical proteins (BGCs) which is the exact\nchemical and biosynthetic space which should be prioritized to identify novel\nantibiotics. Here, approaches to combine data sets consisting of bacterial\ngenomes (and their predicted BGCs), the chemical products of these same strains\nand their bioactivity profiles will be discussed. Several datasets of Actinomycetota\ngenomes have been mined for BGCs and these strains cultured to generate\nmetabolite extracts for comparative metabolomics (high resolution tandem mass\nspectrometry /molecular networking) and antibiotic screening (against a panel of\nclinically relevant pathogens). Driven by biological questions, tools have been\ndeveloped to establish patterns across strains and learn relationships between\nBGC, spectral features and bioactivity – here we will discuss experimental data\nconsiderations and how ’omics information is informing biodiscovery."

    "text": "Title: “Stator: High order expression dependencies finely resolve cryptic states and subtypes in single cell data”\nAbstract: Single cells are typically typed by clustering into discrete locations in reduced dimensional transcriptome space. Here we introduce Stator, a data-driven method that identifies cell (sub)types and states without relying on cells’ local proximity in transcriptome space. Stator labels the same single cell multiply, not just by type and sub-type, but also by state such as activation, maturity or cell cycle sub-phase, through deriving higher-order gene expression dependencies from a sparse gene-by-cell expression matrix. Stator’s finer resolution is clear from analyses of mouse embryonic brain, and human healthy or diseased liver. Rather than only coarse-scale labels of cell type, Stator further resolves cell types into subtypes, and these subtypes into stages of maturity and/or cell cycle phases, and yet further into portions of these phases. Among cryptically homogeneous embryonic cells, for example, Stator finds 34 distinct radial glia states whose gene expression forecasts their future GABAergic or glutamatergic neuronal fate. Further, Stator’s fine resolution of liver cancer states reveals expression programmes that predict patient survival. We provide Stator as a Nextflow pipeline and ShinyApp.\nBio: Ava Khamseh is a Reader (Associate Professor) in Biomedical AI, at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh.

Booking via Inkpath from 23/04\nThe Glasgow Computational Biology Community will be hosting its very first writing retreat as part of the 2025 “Write of Spring” festival!\nThis session is open to anyone with an interest in the field of computational biology, from PGR to professor! Regardless of if you are polishing a manuscript, drafting a grant, or outlining your next big idea, our structured session will allow you to work alongside a multi-disciplinary gathering and away from daily distractions.\nYou’ll have the opportunity to network with fellow computational biologists, with a generous supply of coffee and cake! So come along and join the community and let’s get writing!\n\n\n\nDate: 22nd May, 2025\nTime: 9am-1pm\nLocation: Room 237AB, The Mazumdar-Shaw Advanced Research Centre (ARC), 11 Chapel Lane, University of Glasgow, G11 6EW\n\n\n\n\nQ1: What is a “writing retreat”?\nA1: Writing retreats are sessions led by a facilitator, where participants are encouraged to tackle a measurable writing goal that they would like to complete. This might be something that they have put off and need a little extra motivation to get started on, such as writing up a Thesis chapter or drafting a manuscript. The emphasis is on avoiding distraction and procrastination, in a supportive, structured environment alongside like-minded individuals.\nQ2: What will happen during the retreat?\nA2: Like many other writing retreats, we will utilise the Pomodoro Technique, with blocks of 25 minutes of concentrated writing, interspersed with 5 minute breaks. There will be a longer break halfway through the session, during which participants can choose to network or simply refresh.\nQ3: What should I bring?\nA3: Whether you prefer to write on your laptop, or simply with pen and paper, just make sure you have everything you need to achieve your writing goal. While it is understandable that some participants will need to use the internet, you will be encouraged to have your phone on silent, and forgo checking emails / other distractions. This is both to avoid disturbing fellow attendees, and also to help you maintain focus.\nQ4: Will there be any catering?\nA4: Coffee, tea and seasonal fruit will be available throughout the session. A selection of cakes will be made available during the halfway break. You will have the opportunity to specify any dietary requirements on the Inkpath booking form.\nQ5: Can I join remotely?\nA5: This will be an in-person only session. This will makes things easier to facilitate and avoid any AV-related distractions that a hybrid event can bring. If you are interested in attending a virtual writing retreat, we recommend the 2 hour sessions found on Inkpath, hosted by a network of universities around Europe."

Four interdisciplinary teams developed novel code-based solutions to advance current research problems. The event showed how focused, collaborative work can lead to meaningful progress in computational biology, helping participants turn ideas into practical tools for research. Each team shared their results on the final day with fellow attendees and a panel of judges.\n\n\nWinning Project: Graph-Based Sequence Alignment Storage\nLed by Joseph Hughes, this team developed graph-based frameworks to store sequence alignments more efficiently than traditional formats, reducing redundancy in low sequence diversity datasets (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). Their approach models sequences as paths through nucleotide graphs, enabling scalable and queryable storage with integrated metadata. GitHub\n\n\nImproving Alternative Splicing Visualisation\nWill Haese-Hill’s team built workflows to process RNA-Seq data for better visualisation of alternative splicing in genome browsers. They modularised development across GitHub issues and are preparing their pipeline for publication. GitHub\n\n\n3D Big Data for Medical Imaging\nClaire Mitchell’s group created tools to handle multi-terabyte imaging datasets. They developed scripts converting NGFF (Zarr) to HDF5 using Dask for distributed processing and adapted Neuroglancer for direct Zarr visualisation, streamlining analysis pipelines for large-scale datasets. GitHub\n\n\nMultiomics Integration for Oncology Classification Models\nSimon Fisher’s team integrated miRNA, RNA, DNA, CNV, methylation, and histology data to classify breast cancer samples using multiple machine learning architectures. Their best multimodal model achieved a Weighted F1 of 0.84, matching histology alone. They also prototyped a GUI for data integration and model explainability. GitHub\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead\nAll teams presented impressive outputs and received offers of continued support from the MVLS Research Software Engineering (RSE) team, with some aiming for journal publications. The organisers thank sponsors Centre for Data Science and AI and MVLS NERD for making the event possible. We hope you’ve been inspired to join a team or submit a proposal next year!"

    "text": "First-Ever Glasgow CompBio Writing Retreat: A new tradition in the making?\nThe Glasgow CompBio Community recently held its inaugural writing retreat, an event that brought together around 10-15 enthusiastic members for a dedicated focus on academic writing. This retreat was a proud part of the larger Write of Spring festival, a two-week celebration of academic writing practice led by the University of Glasgow’s Research Culture & Researcher Development Team. The festival’s mission is to create a welcoming and inclusive space for all who engage with academic writing, and the CompBio retreat certainly embodied this spirit.\nThe retreat provided a fantastic opportunity for attendees, including academics, postgraduate researchers, research professionals, technicians, and research staff, to step away from their usual routines and immerse themselves in their writing projects. Participants engaged in focused writing sessions, fostering a productive environment that allowed for significant progress on various research outputs. Beyond the individual writing, the retreat also facilitated valuable networking opportunities, allowing community members to connect, share insights, and build relationships. A key element of the retreat’s structure was goal setting, helping individuals to define clear objectives for their writing during the event and beyond.\nOverall, the feedback from participants was unanimously positive, with calls for more retreats in future. The focused environment, combined with the camaraderie of the CompBio community, made the retreat a well-received and highly beneficial experience for everyone involved. While writing retreats are a well-established practice in the humanities, this event offered a valuable opportunity for researchers in the sciences to benefit from the same model. This successful first retreat bodes well for future collaborations and continued support for academic writing within the Glasgow CompBio community."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nOver two decades ago, we presented the GeneWeaver system that consisted of multiple interacting agents, each endowed with a particular bioinformatics expertise. We orchestrated these systems of agents to cooperate, driven by goals, to annotated bacterial genomes. At the time, we faced two key difficulties: the development of a flexible language for agents to communicate goals to each other and the flexible creation of plans to satisfy these goals.\nCould both these aspects be solved with the recent rise of LLMs and Agentic AI? Will this result in a new era of bioinformatics data and tool integration? Will we all get knowledgeable bioscience assistants?\nThis talk will first provide an introduction to LLMs, Agentic AI and Federated AI for bioinformatics; before outlining the results of a few case studies we have carried out in this area.\n\n← Back to Schedule"

    "text": "Abstract\nMarine environments harbor an extraordinary diversity of microorganisms that represent an untapped reservoir of bioactive compounds and novel biological functions. This keynote will explore how integrating biological questions with cutting-edge ’omics technologies can reveal hidden patterns in microbial communities and guide biodiscovery efforts.\nWe will discuss innovative computational approaches for analyzing multi-omics data from marine microbes, including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics. By focusing on biologically relevant questions about adaptation, symbiosis, and chemical ecology, we can uncover meaningful patterns that would otherwise remain hidden in the complexity of high-dimensional data.\nThe talk will showcase recent discoveries of novel biosynthetic pathways and bioactive compounds from marine microorganisms, demonstrating how hypothesis-driven computational biology can accelerate the discovery of new drugs, enzymes, and biotechnological applications. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities in translating computational discoveries into practical applications for human health and environmental sustainability.\n\n← Back to Schedule"
