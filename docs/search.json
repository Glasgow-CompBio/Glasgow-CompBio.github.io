Come along to one of our events!\n\n\nRegular events to share science and have a chat!\nThe community hosts events to chat about cool innovations in computational biology and bioinformatics. We have events across the university at the main campus at Gilmorehill and at various centres at Garscube and then often head to the pub. Come join us!\n\n\n\nThe next Glasgow Computational Biology conference will happen in 2024. Thanks to all who came to 2023’s great event."
