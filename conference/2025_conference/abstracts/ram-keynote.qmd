## Talk Details

**Time:** Tuesday, 9:40-10:25\
**Speaker:** Ram DasGupta\
**Topic:** Genetics\
**Type:** Keynote

## Abstract

Over two decades ago, we presented the GeneWeaver system that consisted of multiple interacting agents, each endowed with a particular bioinformatics expertise. We orchestrated these systems of agents to cooperate, driven by goals, to annotated bacterial genomes. At the time, we faced two key difficulties: the development of a flexible language for agents to communicate goals to each other and the flexible creation of plans to satisfy these goals.

Could both these aspects be solved with the recent rise of LLMs and Agentic AI? Will this result in a new era of bioinformatics data and tool integration? Will we all get knowledgeable bioscience assistants?

This talk will first provide an introduction to LLMs, Agentic AI and Federated AI for bioinformatics; before outlining the results of a few case studies we have carried out in this area.
