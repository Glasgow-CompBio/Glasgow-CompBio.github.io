**Topic:** Cancer\
**Type:** Keynote

## Abstract

This keynote will explore the application of spatially resolved single-cell analysis to understand how bevacizumab enhances anti-PD1 immunotherapy response in nasopharyngeal cancer. Using cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing technologies, we investigate the complex interactions between tumor cells, immune cells, and the tumor microenvironment following combination therapy.

Our research reveals how bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF therapy, modifies the spatial organization of immune infiltrates and creates a more favorable microenvironment for PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor efficacy. Through detailed spatial mapping, we identify key cellular neighborhoods and communication pathways that predict therapeutic response.

The findings have important implications for understanding combination immunotherapy strategies and developing personalized treatment approaches for nasopharyngeal cancer patients.
