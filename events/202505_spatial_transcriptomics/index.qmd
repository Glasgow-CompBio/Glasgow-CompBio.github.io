We are excited to announce our May event taking place on the **7th of May**, from **3pm**. This month we are off to the Garscube campus and the **CRUK Scotland Institute**.

We have an exciting line-up:

-   **Florent Petitprez** (University of Edinburgh) Spatial transcriptomics to interrogate intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity in glioblastoma

-   **Lucas Zeiger** (CRUK Scotland Institute) Spatial transcriptomics to investigate cell states and therapy resistance in colorectal cancer

-   **Tengyu Zhang** (University of Glasgow) Exploring the spatial patterns in malignant epithelial for pancreatic cancer

Looking forward to seeing you all there,

The CompBio Team
