## Overview 

This comprehensive training course covers advanced Nextflow concepts and best practices for developing robust, maintainable workflows. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, participants will learn essential skills for professional Nextflow development.

**Date:** Nov 6 from 10am to 4pm GMT

**Location:** 422/423, Sir Alwyn Williams Building (School of Computing Science)

### Requirements 

Participants should have some Nextflow experience and understand concepts like processes, workflows, channels, basic operators (e.g. `map`, `collect`), multi-step workflows, modules, and basic configuration. Familiarity with command-line tools, basic scripting, and Docker containers is also expected.

We will be running the training with **GitHub Codespaces**, which provides an integrated development environment directly within a web browser (preferably Google Chrome). The workshop material will be available within the GitHub workspace. Create and connect to a GitHub Codespace before training begins to verify your access works properly by following the provided instructions [here](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/envsetup/01_setup/).
