Hey CompBio folks, weâ€™ve got a slightly different plan for our July event. DeepMind have just put out work on a project known as AlphaGenome. We thought itâ€™d be fun to discuss it.

AlphaGenome is a large DNA language model that supposedly can help understand gene regulation and variant effects. There is a blog post ([https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeepmind.google%2Fdiscover%2Fblog%2Falphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome%2F&data=05%7C02%7CLucas.Farndale%40glasgow.ac.uk%7C0ba57007a5784a130f1f08ddb4d37805%7C6e725c29763a4f5081f22e254f0133c8%7C1%7C0%7C638865542527908930%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=qu27BNvfy%2B%2BDPMk%2FyT77L5WlX2uGbbDZTbWTMULGntk%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/.

For the journal club, Iâ€™ll put together a short presentation to go over the key ideas. And then we can discuss it. Iâ€™d recommend reading the blog post and as much of the paper as you can manage ahead of time so we can have a good discussion.

**What:** Jake Lever will talk about AlphaGenome with plenty of time for some chat

**When:** Sir Alwyn Williams Building (Computing Science): Rooms 422/423

**Where:** 4pm on Thursday July 17^th^

**Preparation:** We recommend reading the above links (as much as you can ðŸ˜Š) and come with ideas/confusion, but not preparation is required!

Plus we will head to the pub afterwards as usual.

Hope to see you there,

The CompBio Team
